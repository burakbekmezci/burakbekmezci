- Hi, my name is Burak Bekmezci.
- I want to become a web developer and am currently learning javascript.
- It has been 2 months since I start studying and I covered the most of HTML5 and CSS3, and a little bit of JavaScript.
- If you are interested in hiring a junior dev, I'm ready to work and learn more of a job as a web developer.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me --> burakbekmezci@gmail.com
